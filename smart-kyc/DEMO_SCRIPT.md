## üéØ Key Differentiators

1. **Grounded Evidence:** Every decision shows bounding boxes (ID extraction) and citations (sanctions matches, adverse media)
2. **Live Rule Teaching:** Analysts can add rules during the demo without restarting the system
3. **Real-time Metrics:** Dashboard updates instantly showing the impact of rule changes
4. **Human-in-the-Loop:** System flags edge cases for review rather than auto-deciding everything
5. **Explainable AI:** Copilot explains every decision with rule IDs, match scores, and recommendations
